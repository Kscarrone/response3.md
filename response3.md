## Summary of Passages

The first passage is labeled “Please stop sending me your shitty Word documents” and is a pretty harsh criticism of individuals who utilize Microsoft word. The author “kindly” uses phrases such as “you” even though it might not refer to the reader specifically. The author sees the purpose of applications such as excel and PowerPoint however he believes that word documents are dead. It is quite ironic that this author says “you” does not apply to the reader necessarily as I type this on word document (laugh at loud). The author continues to list applications that around found on his computer all of which, don’t reference Microsoft word. The next work entitled “Charlie’s Diary” with the subtitle “Why Microsoft Word must Die” is similarly about the widespread hate for Microsoft word which, I was not aware existed until now. This is a very passionate blog post about the burning desire this individual has for Microsoft word to “die.” This Charlie fellow is adamant that Microsoft word is a “near-monopolist.” I think this is a bit of an exaggeration but he believes that it is the spawn of all evil allegedly. The third passage is labeled “Markdown: Markup That’s Downright Simple” and while this text does not outwardly call Microsoft evil it is promoting other types of online writing applications. This article praises the use of markdown claiming it is a dummy-proof text and they even quote our very own Professor Evia which is cool! The article also boasts that the format of markdown is simple by design therefore it is very efficient. The fourth reading is labeled “Guide to Podcasting” this passage divulges the importance of podcasting to represent a form of mobile-first content. The passage also talks about how podcasts are now covering a multitude of revenue streams and getting broader. The final passage is labeled “The RSS Feed Is Born” this webpage has a pretty unique layout divulging when the first podcast was born in September 2003. It also includes interesting facts such as the original podcast boom that included the iPod.
